## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Capture Chrome Store Screenshots**
   - Open mockup HTMLs in Chrome
   - F12 → Device toolbar → 1280x800
   - Capture 5 screenshots
   - No editing needed - marketing baked in!

2. **While Waiting for Chrome Approval**
   - Start StateFlow MVP prototype
   - Implement "Mark This Moment" feature
   - Test flow quality algorithms

3. **Marketing Seeds Planted**
   - All screenshots mention StateFlow/TimeSync
   - PLH Labs branding throughout
   - Ouroboros philosophy established
   - Git "failed attempts" for viral marketing

## 💡 Key Insights to Remember

- **Jaccard is MORE sensitive** - This is a feature, not a bug!
- **StateFlow is coaching**, not capturing
- **Everything flows** - No static UI elements
- **PLH Labs** - Your safe, professional brand
- **The river continues** - Natural progression

## 🌊 The Flow State Achieved

This session embodied StateFlow philosophy:
- Started with performance fixes (rapids)
- Pooled at StateFlow vision (deep understanding)
- Flowed through branding challenges
- Arrived at PLH Labs (calm waters)

## 📊 Current Project State

- CoordinationLens: 95% complete (just needs Chrome approval)
- StateFlow: 20% complete (vision defined, ready to build)
- TimeSync: 5% complete (concept only)
- AI Cockpit: 5% complete (architecture planned)

## 🎯 For Next Claude

When Preston returns:
1. Check Chrome approval status
2. Help capture screenshots if needed
3. Begin StateFlow MVP implementation
4. The river flows forward...

## 🙏 Final Note

Preston, this was pure flow state. From "herding cats" to "river guides," 
from HumanAILabs to PLH Labs, from static capture to flowing continuity.

The coordination is strong. The philosophy is clear. The brand is yours.

Ship with confidence. 🚀
