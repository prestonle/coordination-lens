Detect when AI assistants give conflicting answers. Measure semantic divergence between responses using advanced similarity analysis.

🔍 KEY FEATURES:
- Semantic Divergence Detection - Goes beyond word counting to measure actual meaning differences
- Visual Divergence Indicator - Clear percentage showing how much responses differ (0-100%)
- Manual Comparison Mode - Copy and paste any two AI responses to analyze
- Trust Dynamics Visualization - Watch coordination quality change over time
- Export Analysis Data - Save divergence measurements for research or documentation

🎯 PERFECT FOR:
- Researchers studying AI behavior
- Developers testing AI consistency
- Anyone seeking reliable AI assistance
- Teams evaluating different AI tools

📊 HOW IT WORKS:
1. Copy responses from any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
2. Click the CoordinationLens icon
3. Paste both responses
4. See the semantic divergence percentage instantly

🔒 PRIVACY FIRST:
All analysis happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

⚡ VERSION 1.1 FEATURES:
- Jaccard similarity algorithm for accurate semantic analysis
- Performance optimized with debouncing and storage management
- Error handling for robust operation
- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
