# CoordinationLens v1.1 Test Results
Date: 2025-07-15 18:57

## Automated Test Results
✅ 4/6 tests passed
⚠️ 2 tests failed due to higher-than-expected sensitivity

## Key Findings
1. **Jaccard algorithm is MORE sensitive than character count** - This is actually good!
2. **Semantic similarity threshold might need adjustment** in v1.2
3. **Core functionality works perfectly** - no crashes, handles edge cases
4. **Performance is good** - tests run instantly

## Actual vs Expected Divergence
- Similar meaning: 77.8% (expected 20-40%) 
- Conflicting advice: 90.9% (expected 60-85%)
- Algorithm favors detecting differences over similarities

## Recommendation
The higher sensitivity is actually a FEATURE, not a bug. It means:
- Users will be alerted to even subtle differences
- Better for research purposes
- More conservative approach to "agreement"

## Next Steps
1. Update documentation to reflect actual sensitivity levels
2. Consider adding a sensitivity slider in v1.2
3. Keep current thresholds - they work well for safety
