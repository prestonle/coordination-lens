# AI Cockpit: Software-Based Human-AI Synchronization

## Vision
Replace physical brain-computer interfaces with sophisticated software coordination tools.

## Components Status
- [x] CoordinationLens - Divergence detection (v1.0 in review)
- [ ] StateCapture - Conversation versioning (v0.1 planning)
- [ ] TimeSync - Temporal alignment (concept)
- [ ] ContextBridge - Model handoff (research)
- [ ] WorkloadOptimizer - Task routing (design)
- [ ] QualityGuard - Output validation (prototype)

## Unique Value
Where others pursue hardware (Neuralink), we achieve sync through intelligent interfaces.

## Target Users
- AI Researchers
- Power Users managing multiple AI tools
- Enterprises needing AI orchestration
- Anyone seeking human-AI productivity gains
