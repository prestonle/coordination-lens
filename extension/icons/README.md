# CoordinationLens Icon Evolution

## The Design Journey

This folder chronicles the evolution of the CoordinationLens icon through multiple iterations, each pushing against Chrome Web Store's constraints while maintaining our design vision.

### Design Principles
- **Metaphor**: Lens examining coordination between AI agents
- **Colors**: Blue spectrum representing trust dynamics
- **Style**: Modern, technical, approachable

### Iterations
1. **v1** - Glass morphism approach (too complex for small sizes)
2. **v2** - Neural network visualization (wrong metaphor)
3. **v3** - Coordination rings (beautiful but wrong dimensions)
4. **v4** - Minimal lens (padding issues)
5. **v5** - Final approved design (Chrome compliant)

Each iteration taught us something about balancing innovation with platform requirements.
