# AI Cockpit: The Complete Vision

## What We're Building
A comprehensive suite of browser extensions that create perfect human-AI synchronization through software, not hardware.

## The Instruments

### 1. CoordinationLens (Shipping Now!)
- **Status**: v1.0 in Chrome review
- **Purpose**: Detect when AIs disagree
- **Next**: v1.1 with Jaccard similarity ready

### 2. StateCapture (Next Up)
- **Status**: Design phase
- **Purpose**: Save and version AI conversation states
- **Why**: Never lose a "perfect" AI assistant state again

### 3. TimeSync 
- **Status**: Research
- **Purpose**: Fix AI/human time estimation mismatch
- **Example**: When AI says "1 week", translate to realistic human time

### 4. ContextBridge
- **Status**: Concept
- **Purpose**: Seamless handoff between AI models
- **Goal**: Take conversation from GPT to Claude without losing context

### 5. WorkloadOptimizer
- **Status**: Planning
- **Purpose**: Route tasks to the best AI for the job
- **Smart**: Considers cost, speed, and capability

### 6. QualityGuard
- **Status**: Prototype
- **Purpose**: Catch hallucinations and validate outputs
- **Safety**: Your co-pilot's co-pilot

## The Big Picture
While others build Neuralink, we achieve human-AI sync through intelligent interfaces.

## Revenue Model
- **Free Tier**: Individual tools with limits
- **Pro Tier**: /mo - All tools, unlimited use
- **Team Tier**: /mo - Shared workspaces
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, on-prem options

## Why This Matters
Every knowledge worker will need an AI Cockpit. We're building the instruments they'll rely on.
