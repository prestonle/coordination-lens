# CoordinationLens: The Measurement Layer for Multi-AI Systems

## What We Are NOT:
- Another multi-model chat interface
- A Poe/ChatHub competitor  
- A model aggregator

## What We ARE:
- The coordination failure detection system
- The semantic divergence analyzer
- The trust dynamics monitor
- The measurement layer that makes multi-AI systems trustworthy

## Our Moat:
- First to quantify coordination quality
- Patent-pending trust decay mathematics (Î»=0.15)
- Real-time divergence detection algorithms
- Actionable insights from measurement

## Integration Strategy:
- Chrome extension that enhances ANY multi-model tool
- API for platforms to add coordination measurement
- Standalone dashboard for power analysis
